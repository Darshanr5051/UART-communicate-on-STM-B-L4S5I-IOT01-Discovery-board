# UART-communicate-on-STM-B-L4S5I-IOT01-Discovery-board
B-L4S5I-IOT01A with the UART protocol is a straightforward process that can be used to build a wide range of IoT devices.

# Project Build Steps
-> Here is all you need to do: open the STM32cube IDE and create a new project.

-> Once you are done creating a new project, select your board (mine is B-L4S5I-IOT01), so I am selecting that.

-> After selecting a board, it will ask you to set the permissions of the pin configuration to default.

-> Select "Yes".

-> After that, please refer to the datasheet for the B-L4S5I-IOT01 board (I am also attaching a link to the datasheet below).

-> From the board, select the Tx and Rx pins for UART, which are A0 and A1 from channel 3.
